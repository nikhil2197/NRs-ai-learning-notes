- **[Karpathy - How I Use LLMs](https://youtu.be/EWvNQjAaOHw?si=F8x9pBLFPfnU1G1w)** – Real-world usage masterclass. Long but worth it.
- **[Karpathy - Deep Dive into LLMs](https://youtu.be/7xTGNNLPyMI?si=sxp5d9bTn6jpxXvy)** – Only watch if you're ready to go down the rabbit hole of how AI works.
- **[Stanford CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)** – For when you want to *build* AI.
- **[IBM Tech Explainers on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@IBMTechnology)** - Short form content and quick explainers on new terms. 
  - Fine-tuning vs RAG vs Prompt Engineering
  - Assistants vs Agents
  - Trends for 2025
- **[Replit - Vibe Coding 101](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/vibe-coding-101-with-replit/)** – For learning how to build basic apps in Replit.

## 🧰 Tools I've Used (Ranked by Vibes + Usefulness)

| Tool | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| **Replit** | Best no-code builder - good blend of flexibility for engineers and structure / boundaries for non-engineers |
| **Cursor** | Best for advanced ai-assisted coding workflows |
| **ChatGPT (4o, o1, o3)** | Swiss Knife - first opinion for everything |
| **Claude Sonnet (3.5/3.7)** | Best second opinion coder |
| **Gemini 2.0** | Great second opinion for non-code deep work |
| **Lovable** | Only for very simple stuff |
| **Deepseek R1** | Cool, but feels a little long in the tooth now |
| **Perplexity Pro** | Constraining in the output form - not great for me |
| **Manus AI** | Powerful but needs insane prompting otherwise expensive |
| **GCP Video AI API** | Didn't work well for me |
| **Whisper API** | Very good, but can lag for advance use cases|
| **Eleven Labs** | Great for video voiceover use cases |
| **Hugging Face (Pyannote)** | Exploring - Audio Transcription |
| **Luma Labs – Dream Machine** | Exploring - Video Gen |
| **InVideo** | Exploring – hyperrealistic text-to-video output |
| **Hedra (Character 3)** | Exploring – voice + emotion-driven avatar gen |

### 💥 Great Prompt to generate great prompts (use in o1/o3)
> “You are a cracked prompt engineer who understands the ins and outs of how to get an LLM to give great results. Think you have the skill level of Andrej Karpathy and Andrew Ng. I want you to refine a prompt for me which I will give in the next message.”

## ⚙️ Real-World Use Cases I've Tried / Am Curious About

- 🧥 **AI Stylist** – not for the basic dresser like me
- 🚗 **AI for Car Insurance Decoding** – helpful 1-pass before buying car insurance to understand what you are buying
- 📚 **AI to Build Skill Development Plans** – super helpful to learn anything new - give objective and resources, build a plan
- 🖼 **AI for Creating Landing Pages** – For performance marketing - no more argument on what works / doesn't work 
- 🎨 **AI for Children’s Activities** – very useful but needs good prompting 
- 📈 **AI for Sales Training** – very doable using replit and basic documentation. Easy lift
- ✍️ **AI for Emails and Doc Writing** – most refined use case
- 📊 **AI for Biz Plan + Research** – hit or miss, dependent on creating a strong and comprehensive prompt
- 🍽 **AI for Recipes** – my favorite everyday use case
