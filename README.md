# ‚öôÔ∏è Building AI Products

I've listed some of the products I‚Äôve used directly or am excited about in different consumer categories. Given the strategic direction from model makers like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft etc. It‚Äôs clear that many of today‚Äôs ‚Äúsoftware only‚Äù solutions will soon become integrated mini-apps within their larger ecosystems‚Äîeither organically or via M&A. This leads to the broader product insight below.

## Product Insight

The key to building a sustainable moat in this space is not just about leveraging AI for improved search and discovery. While enhanced search capabilities are valuable, they are only one piece of the puzzle. The real opportunity lies in seamlessly integrating AI into every aspect of the customer journey and experience. Companies that aim to build truly transformative products should think beyond isolated features and instead strive to create holistic, AI-driven experiences that are phygital in nature.

This is analogous to how Tesla approaches Full-Self-Driving‚Äînot just automating one part of the driving process, but crafting a complete, intelligent system that continuously learns and adapts within the familiar form factor of a family vehicle.

While Full-Self-Driving should be the end-point, the path to getting there involves progressive and slow automation of tasks that enable users to build more trust in both the company and the product. _It is evident that we wouldn't trust a car to drive on a highway automatically if we didn't trust it to turn on the windshield wipers or headlights automatically first._

This path allows users to both feel the magic while also providing them with the ability to create the magic, which, over time, becomes more powerful and complex. Some valuable frameworks for building AI-first products are in the below links:

- [Confidence in AI Results as a Metric for Product Success](https://blog.langchain.com/the-hidden-metric-that-determines-ai-product-success/)

## What Determines the Speed and Quality of Progress?

The speed of moving up the ladder and the fidelity of the first product is determined by the following:

### 1. Your use case

If you operate in a world where errors can be extremely costly (medical, legal, fraud-detection), your first use case has to be very small and highly accurate. You need to prioritize accuracy over speed while also ensuring that your users find value in the first mini-step you are automating. For example: Give a warning to turn on headlights in a basement, then automatically turn on headlights, and only then move to other aspects over time as trust in the system increases.

Conversely, if you operate in a low cost function environment, you can provide greater power in the first product with lower accuracy. As in the case of the plethora of content-generation or general purpose LLM apps. Any automation here is valuable and users can fix or re-prompt without causing harm.

### 2. Your users

Typically, new technology has been adopted by power users first, and as a result, their patience for and understanding of the technology allows product builders to get away with rough edges, at least initially. 

Due to the speed of proliferation of AI, product builders don't have the luxury of this anymore. Everyone wants to use the technology, but the technology itself is quite rough around the edges to deliver high quality results consistently without too much input from users or builders (due to its inherent stochastic nature). Thus, a deep understanding of the median abilities of a product‚Äôs users is critical to ensure that the product both helps them and also doesn't require too much effort from them to get that help. 

A good example here is that Cursor or Windsurf can get away with more AI slop because coders and engineers can ID and fix those issues faster via better re-prompting, versus a lesson planning tool targeted at educators in developing countries can't get away with the same quality since they may not have the ability (or interest or incentive) to re-prompt in the right manner. The UI/UX decisions in these cases often become more important than the actual accuracy thresholds.

## The Good News for Product Builders

The power of the models to consistently produce high quality results, the ability of users to use the technology to generate high-quality results, and the trust of users in the technology is all the lowest it will ever be. All three will only go up from here.

At the same time, the cost of prototyping a product in terms of time, money and complexity is the highest it is ever going to be. The onus is now on builders to leverage get educated on AI and make use of the technology out there and get in-front of users to understand their use-case and user faster and more deeply. [Here is a guide to AI prototyping](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/a-guide-to-ai-prototyping-for-product) to help you get started (after you have completed the basic Karpathy / Andrew Ng videos to understand the technology)

### ‚úàÔ∏è **AI Travel Agent**  
I‚Äôm especially bullish on this use case due to the potential for a fully integrated customer journey of **Ideation** -> **Planning** -> **Booking** -> **Experience Delivery**. Success here depends on **"figital"** integration ‚Äì combining digital planning tools with real-world options like hotels, airlines, and attractions.

### üöó **AI for Financial Products**  
AI has the potential to democratize tools historically reserved for hedge funds (e.g., robo-traders, algos) and offer **end-to-end financial and life planning**. Imagine a single platform where you upload your **PAN Card** and instantly compile all active investment accounts, insurance policies, and bank accounts. The advisor could then **continuously optimize** your portfolio as your life and the market evolve. The closest I‚Äôve seen to this is **Cred Money**, but it remains primarily a **"view-only"** app.

### üìö **AI Education and Skill Building**  
The ideal journey here involves: Understanding the user‚Äôs aspirations and habits** -> **Skill baseline assessment** -> **Creating personalized courses with credentialing**. While ChatGPT does well with **study plan creation**, the challenge lies in adding **accountability and content delivery**. Companies like **Coursera** and **Deep Learning** are well-positioned but need better discovery engines. Of interest is Andrej Karpathy's "Eureka Labs". 

_18th May Update:_ I spent a signficant amount of time this week looking for AI in education use cases and the world supported this. Checkout below resources to gain a better framework:

### üì∑ **AI for Content**  
This space represents a superset of the previous two use cases, now expanded to include entertainment ‚Äî specifically **personalized gaming, movie creation, and content generation**. The goal is to create immersive, AI-generated experiences tailored to individual user preferences.

[Nikunj Kothari‚Äôs piece, *Generated Worlds*](https://writing.nikunjk.com/p/generated-worlds) captures the vast potential of this technology brilliantly. In recent weeks (as of June 12, 2025), the launch of Google Veo has triggered a Cambrian explosion in user-generated content. From the viral ‚ÄúTalking Baby Podcast‚Äù to imaginative ‚ÄúYeti / Bigfoot‚Äù videos, anything users can dream up can now be brought to life.

While early adopters have largely been professional content creators, the landscape is quickly shifting. As onboarding and creation tools become more accessible, everyday users will soon be able to generate their own high-quality content on demand.

### üçΩ **AI for Homegoods Use Cases**  
This category is on the cusp of production quality, driven by advancements in **Smart appliances** (vacuums, fridges) that are practical and functional but currently limited by high costs. As costs decrease, adoption will grow, with **new use cases** emerging. I also see this category moving over time from "special purpose" to "general purpose" home assistance robots that will find adoption in high CoL western contries. For the special purpose applications such as vacuum cleaners (the most popular use case) - over time the requirement of "human in the loop" will come down.
