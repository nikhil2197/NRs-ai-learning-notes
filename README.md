### 🧰 AI Tool Rankings

| Tool | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| **Replit** | Best no-code builder - good blend of flexibility for engineers and structure / boundaries for non-engineers. However once at 90%, becomes a hammer to do brain surgery. |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI** | Current fav for ai-assisted coding |
| **Cursor** | Second for advanced ai-assisted coding workflows |
| **ChatGPT (4o, o1, o3)** | Swiss Knife - first opinion for everything |
| **Gemini 2.0** | Great second opinion for non-code deep work |
| **Lovable** | Only for very simple stuff e.g. tic-tac-toe game. Let down by not providing ability to download code base and setup advanced workflows offered by replit.|
| **Deepseek R1** | Cool initially, but feels a little long in the tooth now |
| **Perplexity Pro** | Constraining in the output format - not great for me but can see this being useful to less tech-native users who desire scaffolding on AI usage |
| **Manus AI** | Powerful but needs very high quality and specific prompting with tasks and desired outputs otherwise expensive |
| **GCP Video AI API** | Didn't work well for me |
| **Whisper API** | Very good, but can lag for advance use cases|
| **Whisper Large-V3 local** | Significantly better than above but needs a smaller audio window for achieving the best results|
| **Eleven Labs** | Great for video voiceover use cases |
| **Luma Labs – Dream Machine** | Exploring - Video Gen |
| **InVideo** | Exploring – hyperrealistic text-to-video output |
| **Hedra (Character 3)** | Exploring – voice + emotion-driven avatar gen |

# ⚙️ Real-World Consumer Use Cases I've Tried / Am Curious About

I’ve listed some of the products I’ve used or am currently exploring in each category. Given the product direction from leading LLM model makers like OpenAI, Google, and Meta, it’s clear that many of these solutions will soon evolve into integrated mini-apps within their broader ecosystems. I’m constantly experimenting with new products and will keep this list updated as I explore more options.

_Product Insight_:
The key to building a sustainable moat in this space is not just about leveraging AI for improved search and discovery. While enhanced search capabilities are valuable, they are only one piece of the puzzle. The real opportunity lies in seamlessly integrating AI into every aspect of the customer journey and experience.

Companies that aim to build truly transformative products should think beyond isolated features and instead strive to create holistic, AI-driven experiences. This is analogous to how Tesla approaches "Full-Self-Driving" – not just automating one part of the driving process, but crafting a complete, intelligent system that continuously learns and adapts.

In the same way, companies in this space should focus on building AI solutions that go beyond isolated functions and work as cohesive, end-to-end experiences. For a more in-depth perspective, check out the "Next-100" link in the readings section.


### 🧥 **AI for Ecommerce**  
The ultimate AI stylist would seamlessly integrate **Discovery** -> **SKU Selection** (size, fit, color) -> **Payment** -> **Delivery** -> **Returns and Re-engagement**. A potential model here could resemble Bonobos, offering a highly personalized, end-to-end shopping experience.

### ✈️ **AI Travel Agent**  
I’m especially bullish on this use case due to the potential for a fully integrated customer journey of **Ideation** -> **Planning** -> **Booking** -> **Experience Delivery**. Success here depends on **"figital"** integration – combining digital planning tools with real-world options like hotels, airlines, and attractions.

### 🚗 **AI for Financial Products**  
AI has the potential to democratize tools historically reserved for hedge funds (e.g., robo-traders, algos) and offer **end-to-end financial and life planning**. Imagine a single platform where you upload your **PAN Card** and instantly compile all active investment accounts, insurance policies, and bank accounts. The advisor could then **continuously optimize** your portfolio as your life and the market evolve. The closest I’ve seen to this is **Cred Money**, but it remains primarily a **"view-only"** app.

### 📚 **AI Education and Skill Building**  
The ideal journey here involves: Understanding the user’s aspirations and habits** -> **Skill baseline assessment** -> **Creating personalized courses with credentialing**. While ChatGPT does well with **study plan creation**, the challenge lies in adding **accountability and content delivery**. Companies like **Coursera** and **Deep Learning** are well-positioned but need better discovery engines. Of interest is Andrej Karpathy's "Eureka Labs". 

_18th May Update:_ I spent a signficant amount of time this week looking for AI in education use cases and the world supported this. Checkout below resources to gain a better framework:  

- [No Priors Pod with DuoLingo CEO Luis Von Ahn](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qCX9uw3tHBgaAFqMFfrAB?si=hZIc_4JIQxeaE775pQGVEQ&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A0O65xhqvGVhpgdIrrdlEYk&nd=1&dlsi=23b0b9dcebcf4f63): DuoLingo has been at the forefront of adopting AI in education and delivering outcomes. This pod shares his vision for the world. Particularly improtant is solving the motivation gap using smarter and more personalized content delivery. 
- [Learning chess aloud](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/chess-dot-com): A eleven labs implementation with Chess.com to create a personalized coach / commentator. Try it out [here](https://www.learnchesswithdrwolf.com/)
- [Masterclass On Call](https://oncall.masterclass.com/): Similar to the eleven labs implementation, Masterclass has used celebrity voices to help create personalized coaching. Making their core product feel more 1:1 rather than 1:Many. See demos [here](https://x.com/omooretweets/status/1922308912155439477). 
- [AI Samarth](https://cms.foundationallearning.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AI-Samarth-AI-Literacy-Framework-May-2025.pdf): A white paper by the central-square foundation in India detailing out a framework for driving AI literacy in K-12 schools in India (particularly tier 2 and below India - colloquially "Bharat"). Helping students move from being passive to power users of the technology.

### 🎨 **AI for Children**  
Providing quality engagement for children while supporting parents in a **child-friendly, screen-free** manner is the key challenge. A succesful form factor will likely in **integrating AI within toys and child furniture** to offer safe, interactive learning and fun.

### 📷 **AI for Content**  
This space represents a superset of the previous two use cases, now expanded to include entertainment — specifically **personalized gaming, movie creation, and content generation**. The goal is to create immersive, AI-generated experiences tailored to individual user preferences.

[Nikunj Kothari’s piece, *Generated Worlds*](https://writing.nikunjk.com/p/generated-worlds) captures the vast potential of this technology brilliantly. In recent weeks (as of June 12, 2025), the launch of Google Veo has triggered a Cambrian explosion in user-generated content. From the viral “Talking Baby Podcast” to imaginative “Yeti / Bigfoot” videos, anything users can dream up can now be brought to life.

While early adopters have largely been professional content creators, the landscape is quickly shifting. As onboarding and creation tools become more accessible, everyday users will soon be able to generate their own high-quality content on demand.

### 🍽 **AI for Homegoods Use Cases**  
This category is on the cusp of production quality, driven by advancements in **Smart appliances** (vacuums, fridges) that are practical and functional but currently limited by high costs. As costs decrease, adoption will grow, with **new use cases** emerging.
